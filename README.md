# Dish-E
Dish-E is web app where users can search for a meal using only one main ingredient that they have and get different recommendations. The reccomendations come with a recipe instruction and a youtube video of further explanation. It was built using Figma for the UI design, HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, Javascript and JQuery for functionality and the MealDB API for reccomendation.

The name Dish-E comes from the word "Dishi" which means eat in Kenyan Slang.
